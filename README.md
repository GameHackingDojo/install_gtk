# install_gtk
A simple program that will automate downloading and installing gtk4 on Windows
GTK4 is needed to run all my GUI programs including Muramasa, Kenjector, Kownloader...

This program will download and install MSYS2 from msys2.org if it isn't already installed.
It will then make should that gtk4 is installed.
At the end, it will add msys2 to the PATH
